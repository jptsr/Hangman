# Hangman

### Creation of a hangman as a responsive website

***I had 3 days to design and make the structure.***  

There's several modes to begin with : easy, normal, hard and a BeCode mode (wich contains all of the names of the promotion). When you select a mode, the game begins. You can choose a letter with the virtual or physical keyboard. When the letter is selected, it disappears and the counter goes up if the letter is wrong. In addition, a part of the hangman is drawn. If the letter is correct, it appears on the screen. You have 7 chances to guess the word. You loose when the hangman is fully drawn. There's a button menu (to get back to the menu) and a button to change the word.

Here is the link to test [my project](https://jptsr.github.io/Hangman/).<br>
ENJOY !
